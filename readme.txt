In case the smart contract address become invalid, you can follow these steps to redeploy:
1. copy `CollabLearn.sol` in Remix
2. compile and deploy the .sol file (as assign 3)
3. copy the contract address into `collab-learn/src/utils/contract.js`


remark: for those functions that interact with smart contract,
        you may need to wait a few minutes for the Holesky testnet (depend on the traffic) for contract confirmation
